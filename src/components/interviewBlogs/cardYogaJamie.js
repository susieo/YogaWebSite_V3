    <b>What drew you to yoga?</b>
        Initially the physical challenge then I started to notice a shift in my mental state, anger leaves after class. Deep down I wanted to teach, but I didn’t feel like GF was it. I had also a bulging disc and I noticed my pain response changed, so I went back to yoga. I wanted to share this practice because it would help anyone else.  
    
    <b>What do you think draws people to your class?</b>
        Purposeful sequencing. Skillful movements. Attention to details without striving for perfection. A safe space.
    <b>How has your teaching style evolved?</b>
        It is much more specific. It has so much more purpose. It is a much more conscious practice than how it originated.
    <b>How do you keep your classes fresh?</b>
        By taking other people’s classes. I am always online looking up stuff. CEC’s with workshops. Getting on my mat and reading books. I am currently taking a functional fitness training certification; so many yoga cues goes against body’s mechanics. I learn to work with the bodies natural ways in asana practice. It is more harmony with the body.
    <b>What does your current yoga practice look like?</b>
        I sit everyday. Meditation everyday. ===1. Spinal warmup, pranayama, nadi shodana are the primary components. Several days a week – it is my personal practice. It is what I love to do and baking.
    <b>How do you feed back into yourself? You have a lot going on with work, kids, </b>
        That is really hard. I end up depleted in a sense, but I think my career paths both nourish me. Dharma-I think that is where my heart lies. I think that the work I do is so satisfying to my heart and soul that it doesn’t run me dry. I have an amazing husband, parents, -I prioritize, I really get clear on what my focus is for my next day. I eat well. My meditation practice helps.
    <b>Where do you feel challenged in your yoga practice or with yoga in general?</b>
        Practice-with the end levels of asana- headstand, handstand, the drive to just do it. Having that harmony for that person’s body. Challenged in strict alignment in that this is the way for this asana. Also we are using asana to teach all 8 limbs of yoga. Our teachers need body mechanics to help create healthy movement patterns.  
    <b>Where do you see yoga as a whole going?</b>
        I feel like it is been so trending that I have to wonder if a if it might fizzle a little. The physical level. Another vision with all these teachers, we many get more skillful cueing the physical shapes. Classical asana may change. “ie- glute activation- (SI issues)
    <b>What do you think makes a great teacher?</b>
        Presence, like being in the room. Not having judgement of such conditioning that they can see only 1 way or one thing. Ability to sense what the room needs and maybe change where they go. 100 percent compassion. Because yoga has the potential to dive into. Safe space and resonance without layering their crap or anything on top of it. Righteousness -they know what they know. Rigidity ie- cueing -sensation a lot- smile
    <b>Who would you take classes from?</b>
        Initial response- Teresa Murphy, Lori Gaspar, Ashley Turner, Jules Mitchell, Rod Styker
        Text response- Theresa Murphy, Indu Arora, Ashley Turner, and Melina Meza
    <b>Advice?</b>
        Yogis/aspiring yogis- Patience with yourself, with your students, with your practice, don’t ride the mental train of it. Don’t let that be who you are. You don’t have to be a Rockstar everytime. Take time to get clear on your purpose/intention.
