    <b> 1. What drew you to practice yoga?</b>
- A girlfriend back in 2011 insisted I go to this "wild" class. It was with Rusty Wells. There was 150 people, sweating and chatting ecstatically before class the class even began. The chanting, the heat, the strong practice... it was powerful beyond belief. So after that day I went back most days for 2 years straight.
  a. What led to the decision for you to teach yoga?
-It definitely wasn't a decision. It just happened. My teacher offered me a scholarship for my first training and the yoga just kept working. Desk life felt less and less appealing. People kept asking me to teach them. So I did...and I continue to to this day. It has been a way for me to share the joy of living deliberately with others. The yoga poses are just tools to reach people-- to speak to their hearts that have been often beaten to a pulp by life. So I keep coming back because it feels intuitive and right and authentically me. I get to play and sweat with people everyday! It doesn't feel like work... and who wants to WORK? Not me. 

<b>2. In the years that you have taught, what specifically do you think draws people to your class? </b>
-You tell me? I think my classes offer people a slightly different picture of what yoga can be. It doesn't need to be so rigid and JUST about the body, or even the breath. It can very much be a heart and spirit practice, and awaken dormant energies that have been too long neglected. I keep it light. One student said that she liked that I took the practice seriously, but I don't take myself seriously. And I try to leave my ego at the door, and I often say to myself "This isn't about me" before I walk into the room. My job is to make the space for folks to unfold and have whatever type of experience they NEED. 

<b>3. Our teaching, like our personal practice is constantly evolving. How has your teaching style evolved?</b>
-I've become more comfortable in my skin. I've gotten better at walking in the studio with zero plan or sequence or chant and just trusting that I have everything I need in my tool kit to co-create something powerful with the beautiful beings in front of me. Earlier I used to try to make this elaborate sequence and plan some dharma talk but it always felt forced. I finally feel free to just dance and jive with present moment energy. 

<b>4. What do you do in order to keep your classes fresh? I.e-continuing education</b>
-I take multiple trainings every year. Studentship is on-going-- it never stops. I also try to stay as close to my teachers as possible-- I assist their workshops, trainings and public classes. It keeps me humble, and curious and learning new things constantly. Studentship is deeply important. And I keep practicing and studying on my own. 

<b>5. What is your personal practice like? Specifically? :)</b>
- I sit every morning (it's taken many years to make this consistent). and if I have time will go through an asana practice. This sometimes means just rolling around on the floor with a bolster and a strap, other times its a more sweaty, vigorous party with music. There's no plan, just to move and listen to my body. I also go to a couple classes a week. I try to study the texts several times a week too. And I'm always chanting mantra. Always!

<b>6. Where do you feel challenged in your yoga practice or with yoga in general?</b>
-Committing to a more regular and discipled asana practice. I don't really work towards specific poses or have "goals." My personal practice is "okay--" which is to say, I don't push very hard. I try a handstand every few days. I guess I'd sometimes like to put a bit of a fire under my butt to work harder in asana. So that's challenging... just getting my butt in motion :) 

<b>7. I noticed from your website that you teach retreats in addition to classes. What do you do for self care or to "feed" back into yourself?</b>
-Leading retreats is nourishing for me! I create a lot of space for myself. I don't really socialize with the students outside of class/practice times so really make this time for me too. I also get massages, go to hot springs, practice with my teachers and listen to good dharma talks and podcasts to keep me inspired. 

<b>8. Where do you see yoga going as a whole?</b>
- I have absolutely no idea. It's shifted a lot from what was initially offered to us, so no clue!

<b>9. What do you think makes a great teacher?</b>
-My teacher asked me this a while ago too. Lots of things. When they can be authentically themselves and not try to fit into the "costume" of someone else-- their teacher or even a teacher they admire. When someone can just own their own stuff and share that truly, it resonates with people. Just being raw and truthful with students, without making it about you and your story....people crave that realness. Longevity helps-- just being steeped in the practice for many years CAN make a great teacher, but there are of course many teachers who have been doing this for a long time who are not very "good" at what they do. 

<b>10. Do you have any advice that you would like to share with: (open ended question)</b>

a. Aspiring yogis/yogis - Practice. 
b. Aspiring yoga teachers/teachers- Be a student of yoga, not a teacher. All these "teacher trainings" should really be called Student Trainings. We don't need more yoga teachers who haven't lived life and love and loss. We need dedicated practicioners who are working deeply on themselves!

For my own interest- at this point in your life, who would you be most interested in studying with? ... Teachers, practitioners, fitness, medical etc
