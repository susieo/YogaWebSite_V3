    <b> Why did you decide to teach yoga?</b>
          I read the Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yoganada, For Lovers of God Everywhere by Roger Housden. It helped me to realize that compared to religion their viewpoint believed that “you are born with all the right tools.” Raised with religion.
        <b> In the years that you have taught, what do you think draws ppl to yoga and your class?</b>
          Pranayama and meditation- help people to reach meditation
        <b>Our teaching like our yoga practice is constantly evolving. How has your teaching style evolved?</b>
          Iyengar-lately energetic-clearly tell the students what they are looking for
        <b>In 1999, the yoga alliance was established. What do you think about the direction of it?</b>
          They are a little behind the pulse. I think yoga is moving towards being more therapeutic and psychological.
        <b>Do you have balance since you are so immersed in your passion which is also your work?</b>
          I love teaching yoga, but it is difficult to have balance. I am making a living by doing my passion. I also teach at the college as well as classes and workshops and teacher trainings.
        <b>How do you keep your teaching style fresh?</b>
          I take a couple of classes each week with other teachers. Miranda Stopworth- she is somatic/yoga therapy, Linda Tropman- she is Iyengar focused; I also take online modules.
        <b>What do you think makes a great teacher?</b>
          When they can communicate their own love and reach their needs. They teach to the class. They are not trying to be “stars”
        <b>Do you have any advice?</b>
          Make sure you are challenged. Learn Sanskrit. Learn to sequence. Learn sutra 1.2. Learn how to break stuff down to meet students where they are. Learn philosophy. Make sure you attend a good, complete program.
        <b>Where do you see your yoga journey going?</b>
          People navigate naturally towards you. Who you are personally seems to inform where your yoga goes. Where you put your energy and who we are attracts where we go with this.
        <b>Do you have any books or authors that you recommend?</b>
          Yoga Nidra by Richard Miller- it is koshas based. Sri Saundarya Lahari- Swami Satyasanjanayda Sarasuak, Siva Sutras, The Yoga of Supreme Identity Jaideva Singh, Vendenta, Conscious Philosophy, Sarah Shores
        <b>Misc.</b>
          I had a fear of letting go. Storm. “It was all in my shrevidia head”
        <b>What is your personal practice like?</b>
        I figure what kind of sleep I had last night which directs my practice for today.
        Pranayama
        Mantra- Affirmations is a day. Mala beads with 108 rounds could be for 6 months to a year
        Meditate- I feel myself expanding
