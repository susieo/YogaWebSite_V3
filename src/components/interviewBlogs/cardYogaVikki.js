    <b>What drew you to yoga?</b>
        Practice 20, teach 18, church -approached pastors. Christian music needed to be played. Rob Bell- mass hill yoga class for 1 year. East Hills Athletic Club- the health club members were not familiar with yoga. I had them face away from the mirrors- so it could be a more auditory class in order to help facilitate a mind/body connection. After the birth of her 3rd son she experienced Post partum depression. I thought someone in this family needs to be calm; I tried a lot of holistic approaches. Then I tried a yoga dvd and I knew right away that this is what I want to do. It happened quickly- family, all teachers- as soon as I found something that I am so passionate about – I knew about
        There weren’t yoga packages initially. Felt important to me to offer flow and honoring different schools of yoga. I believe sessions are the best way to practice.
        What led to the decision to become a studio owner? Started with a business partner = about 1 year.
        What does being a studio owner look like?
    <b>As a studio owner, are you seeking to create a certain culture? Crowd via instructors</b>
        2 different kinds of students, beginners new students who feel safe. Our teachers are so skilled  and well trained; people who have been doing yoga for a very long time-they want philosophy, mediation, and pranayama.
    <b>How do you plan your yoga sequences?</b>
        Save- refine, depending on season, moon cycle, and world
    <b>What does your current practice look like?/</b>
        Some days- restorative; somatic work like TS Little- “sensory awareness training for yoga attunement” active practice-inversions minwe and mini vini’s. Looking for spaces in between the breath. Meditate- it is the first thing I do. At least I know that I have done my sitting practice.
        The transformation comes by practicing. Reading helps us to discern how to practice.
    <b>Personal practice like?/</b>
        I’m an introvert; bigger retreats with 4-5 days of solitude. I believe anything can be healed by silence and solitude and eating healthy.
        I would like to backpack, to start small and be a day hiker, it serves me, it helps to develop nonattachment. I would like to go to the upper peninsula eventually for 3-4 day trips. No goal.
    <b>Biggest challenge of being a studio owner?/</b>
        Making money. If you want to offer yoga with some depth; the physical style is popular- there is a reason why.
    <b>What do you think makes a great teacher?/</b>
        Hoops: Give them free yoga for a month-see if they come and practice. I want a teacher with humility. Embody the practice; authenticity-doesn’t mean vegan.
    <b>Best thing about being a studio owner?/</b>
        The students, when you see their person transform. It’s worth it.
    <b>Advice?/</b>
        Keep going deeper. If you just scratch the surface with a physical practice then you are only going to go so far. If you’re really courageous, patterns of your own junk-through self study, then I believe anything can be transformed. Keep practicing.
    <b>Misc./</b>
        4 main styles of yoga?	Iyengar, Ashtanga, Parayoga, Kris Macharya, Iygenga, Patabi Joji, Desikchar
